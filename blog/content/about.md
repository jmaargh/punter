# Hello, punter

This blog is to document my progress having fun experimenting with writing path
tracing systems with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Initially inspired by
[smallpt](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/), my main goals are to:

- have fun,
- learn to write good Rust,
- learn more about graphics programming in general and path tracing in
  particular.

If you've stumbled across this I hope you can find it interesting and that I
haven't abandoned the project.

##  The name

Nothing special, just a silly tripartite portmanteu of "Path Tracing", "Rust",
and "fUN".
